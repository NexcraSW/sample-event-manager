# sample-event-manager #
This is sample code for a custom event manager I wrote for a video game project I worked on. It was used with the HTML 5 ImpactJS engine. This event manager features dual event queues to prevent infinite loops caused by events spawning other events. A more finalized and complicated version was used in the final shipped product.
